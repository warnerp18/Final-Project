This project was built as my Final Project at the end of my 12 week intensive course at The Iron Yard in Houston, TX. 

I decided on remaking a dog adoption site because back in September I was looking to adopt a dog. I came across a lot of dog sites, but one in paticular stuck out to me. https://www.gbrr.org If you checked out the site for yourself you can see the site is just ugly and outdated. It needed to be redone. So, I decided to take on the challege for my final project and see what I could do. 

I still need to get in touch with the organization in the near future, but right now there is still a lot that needs to be done if they were to use it. 

If Golden Beginnings decides to take my work I will not be selling it to them; instead I will donate it to them as charity work. 

I did use bootstrap for my design as I wanted to focus on the JavaScript side of it and to insure I could complete the requirements of the final projects by the due date. 

This app was built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Backbone, BackboneFire, Firebase, Bootstrap, Chai/Mocha, Gulp, Stripe, jQuery, Lo-Dash/Underscore, and Path.js.
